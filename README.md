# DistrictGeneration_Frontend
The information below describes the semester project for Spring 2019 Section 2 of CSE308, along with the due dates for each of the project components. The goal of the prject is to design and develop a system that will automatically generate a congressional district based on a set of objectives and constraints. Secondary goals are the evaluation of a graph partition algorithm for the first stage in the automated generation of congressional districts. Central to the project is the representation of voting precincts in a state as a connected graph. Project teams will assemble data from a variety of sources for each of the precincts in a state. For example, details of the demographic make-up of a precinct will be assembled from US Census data. The project will also feature a batch capability so that multiple possible districting solutions can be generated with a single request.
